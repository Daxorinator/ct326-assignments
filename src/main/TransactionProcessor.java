/**
 * A runnable class which processes Transaction objects in the Bank's transactionQueue.
 * A TransactionProcessor object must be instantiated with a Bank object to pull transactions from, and a name to identify the object.
 *
 * While running, pulls the next Transaction from the top of the Bank's transactionQueue.
 * The Transaction is checked for a poison-pill which if detected will cause the Runnable to finish and the Thread to exit.
 * Otherwise, the Transaction is sorted by value, if the Transaction value is negative then a withdrawal is initiated for the associated Account of the Transaction.
 * If the Transaction value is positive, then a deposit is initiated for the associated Account of the Transaction.
 *
 * If the Account does not have a sufficient balance to process a withdrawal, the withdrawal is aborted and an error is printed, then the Transaction is discarded.
 *
 * If the Thread takes more than 5 seconds to acquire a new Transaction to process, then the Thread exits.
 *
 * Between Transactions, the Thread sleeps for a random amount of time between 0 and 1 second.
