/**
 * A runnable class which produces random Transaction objects and puts them in the Bank's transactionQueue.
 * A TransactionProcessor object must be instantiated with a Bank object to put transactions into, and a name to identify the object.
 *
 * While running, generates a random Transaction with a value between -10,000 Euro and 10,000 Euro, for a random Account attached to the Bank object.
 * Exits if the Thread is interrupted, which is usually only caused by calling shutdown() or shutdownNow().
 *
 * Between generating Transactions, the Thread sleeps for a random amount of time between 0 and 1 second.
 *
 * Once interrupted, the RandomTransactionGenerator inserts a "poison-pill". A Transaction object with an Account Number of 0, which is not valid.
 * TransactionProcessors will pick this up and interpret this to mean the Queue has been closed and no more transactions will be submitted, causing them to shutdown also.
