/**
 * The NctTestCentre class represents an NCT Test Centre.
 * This class is responsible for instantiating valid NCT Test Centres,
 * with a test centre name and address. It also ensures that there is
 * an NctBookingSlotWebservice available for each NctTestCentre object,
 * so that valid booking dates and times may be fetched where one is not
 * specified in the NctBooking object at the time of instantiation.
