/**
 * The main class is responsible for declaring and instantiating a new Bank object, and adding accounts to it.
 * By default, this class declares and instantiates two TransactionProcessor threads and one RandomTransactionGenerator thread.
 * The TransactionProcessor threads are executed by a FixedThreadPool and the RandomTransactionGenerator is executed by a SingleThreadExecutor.
 * To test the TransactionProcessor, the RandomTransactionGenerator is allowed to run for 10 seconds before its threadpool is forcefully shutdown.
 * The TransactionProcessor threads are then allowed to exit gracefully, which gives them time to process any remaining transactions present on the Bank object.
 * Once the TransactionProcessor threadpool has shutdown, the states of each account in the Bank are printed.
