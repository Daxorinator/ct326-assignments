 * The application entrypoint.
 * Spawns a new ApplicationController.
 *
 * This application follows the Model-View-Controller paradigm.
 * The ApplicationController serves as the controller and dictates how and when data is displayed.
 * The Views for the application are contained in the MusicLibrary and TrackList classes. These classes represent the current state of the model classes, on the screen.
 * The Models for the application are contained in the Album and LibraryLoader classes. These classes hold the application data and are modified by the controller.
